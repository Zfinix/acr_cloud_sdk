# ACR Cloud SDK
`** This is an unofficial SDK for flutter`

Automatic content recognition (ACR) is an identification technology to recognise content played on a media device or present in a media file. This enables users quickly obtain detailed information about the content they have just experienced without any text based input or search efforts.



## ü§î How ACR works
ACR can help users deal with multimedia more effective and make applications more intelligent. [More info](https://docs.acrcloud.com/tutorials/recognize-music).

### üöÄ Initialize SDK

```dart
  final AcrCloudSdk arc = AcrCloudSdk();
  
      arc..init(
          host: '', // obtain from https://www.acrcloud.com/ 
          accessKey: '', // obtain from https://www.acrcloud.com/ 
          accessSecret: '', // obtain from https://www.acrcloud.com/ 
          setLog: false,
        )..songModelStream.listen(searchSong);
  
  void searchSong(SongModel song) async {
      print(song); // Recognized song data
  }
```

Initialize sdk and listen for song recognition events.

### Ô∏èüé∂ Start Recognition

```dart
 bool started = await arc.start();
```
- This function will automatic start the recording and recognizing process.
- When there‚Äôs a result, songModelStream & resultStream will return the data as events.
- The whole recognition time is controlled by ACRCloud‚Äôs Server.
- You can call the stop function to terminate this process.

### ‚õî Stop Recognition

```dart
 bool started = await arc.stop();
```
- This function will cancel the recognition immediately.
